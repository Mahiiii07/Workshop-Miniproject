# IMAGE CLASSIFICATION GAME using resnet18

# This is a mini image classification game built using the ResNet18 model, Gradio,Torchvision and PyTorch. The game allows users to upload an image and guess its name. The model predicts the image label, and the userâ€™s input is compared with the actual prediction.

# Key Features:
# ResNet18 (a pre-trained deep learning model) for image classification.
# Implements real-time scoring with count_of_correct_answer and total_answers.
# Case-insensitive comparison ensures better user experience.
# Gradio-based UI for an interactive web-based experience.
# PyTorch is used for deep learning inference 
# Torchvision for loading the pre-trained ResNet18 model and image transformations to ensure proper input format.
